# Ola Data Analytics 🚖📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Ola ride data analysis** using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI** to derive meaningful insights. It includes data cleaning, query execution, and dashboard visualization to analyze customer behavior, ride statistics, and payment trends.

## 🗂️ Files & Directories
- **Bookings - July.csv** → Raw and cleaned Excel data files.
- **queries.sql** → SQL queries for data analysis.
- **Ola Data Analytics.pbix** → Power BI dashboard file for visualization.
- **README.md** → Documentation for the project.

## 🔍 Data Analysis Approach
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicates and null values.
- Standardized column names and formats.
- Handled inconsistent data.

### 2️⃣ SQL Analysis
Performed multiple queries to gain insights, including:
- **Average customers per day** (`avg_cus`)
- **Income per ride** (`incom_ride`)
- **Max/Min driver ratings** (`max_min_driver_rate`)
- **Cancelled rides by customers & drivers** (`no_of_cancelled_by_cus`, `number_of_cancelled_ri`)
- **Total successful bookings** (`success_bookings`)
- **Top 5 customers by spend** (`top_5_customers`)

### 3️⃣ Power BI Visualization
Created an interactive dashboard that:
- Shows key ride statistics.
- Displays income trends.
- Analyzes customer behavior.
- Highlights payment method insights.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Divyanshusingh152/Ola-Data-Analytics.git
   ```
2. Open `Bookings - July.csv` in Excel for raw data.
3. Execute `queries.sql` in MySQL or any compatible SQL environment.
4. Load `Ola Data Analytics.pbix` in Power BI to explore visualizations.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add more datasets for deeper insights.
- Implement ML models for ride demand prediction.
- Automate data pipeline for real-time updates.
